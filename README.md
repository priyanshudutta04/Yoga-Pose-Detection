## About

This project uses YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and a TensorFlow model for yoga pose classification. It captures live video, detects the presence of a person, extracts and analyzes their pose to provide accurate yoga pose identification. This system helps ensure correct yoga practice by providing immediate feedback on pose accuracy.

## Data

The datataset used is the roboflow's  `Yoga Pose Computer Vision Project`, which includes numerous images for each of the 107 yoga poses.
